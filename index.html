									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/CD-Project-Ewing.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this Project we were to pick one of our current favorite songs and make an Album cover as well as a CD cover that reflects the message of the song you chose.<br /> 
										I chose a song called Missing My Idols by artist Trippie Redd. This song spoke of the classic kings of Hip-Hop and how the music industry just isn't the same without their influence.

									<p>In my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course this was my groups final.<br /> 
										We used Bayseian statistics to create a console application that could predict the probability of a champ, a team, a player, and a champ considering the player winning based on data used from 5 years of LCS (League Championship Series) data.<br />
										 We also applied the OneR statistic as an extra test of how A.I could be applied.</p>

									<p>This was my final project for my first course involving Unity. We were to take a classic game clone it, but not simply just that.<br />
										 We were to add our own twist to the game and add new mechanics, a new perspective and our own story to this. In this game you play as the ghost against a horde of Pac-Men who are stealing your family's food.<br />
										 You must chase down all 3 Pac-Men and stop them from finishing all the food in your current shed, which is the current level.
